## Reflection 

### **What im trying to do:**
I wanted to make a pictonary- style game with real-time communnication in a multiplayer game on a simple website. After entering the site, users should be promted to enter their name, select the word they want to draw, and draw their word on a canvas, while chat functionality with socket.io allows real time communication between users and server. 

### **How well is it going:**
I got the overall game, as I was able to test a couple existing examples locally. 

### **Where i'm getting stuck:**
I was struggling getting the draw functonality working and multiplayer communication. 

### **How it works:**

build instructions and user guide can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/angelesmarinbatana/Drawing-Game/tree/main/documentation) folder
